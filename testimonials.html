      <p>"My family has used Harry for years to protect our cat from me when they go out of town. I came here years ago from the planet of Melmac, where cats are a delicacy. I would love to get my claws on the family feline. Thanks to Harry, Peaches is safe and secure. For now."</p>

     <p>"I hired Harry to assist me with breaking in to the movie business. Harry has accelerated my martial arts training in Kung Fu with many long personal hours. In 2007, I was hired by Dreamworks Studio and Paramount Pictures to star in the movie called Kung Fu Panda which was released in 2008. Harry is amazing, his martial arts knowledge is outstanding. I just released the third installment of Kung Fu Panda, called Kung Fu Panda 3. It's now out in theatres, go check it out"!</p>
