        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          The world is a big and scary place out there.  As a sasquatch in a homo sapien world I am living in a world that was not designed for me.  Despite my species being terrible at adaption, I am surprisingly helpful in some specific categories of work and I am seeking employment on a contract basis. <br />
          Also, the city of Seattle is increasingly expensive and despite years of stability and happiness in the Seattle metropolitan area, even my homelands around Lake Sammamish and Issaquah are ridiculously expensive and my family is being pushed out--thanks gentrification.  I would love your support!  Please hire me!
        </p>
        <h2>Experience</h2>
        <p>
        I have extensive work experience.  While I have worked my whole life and I have tons of experience doing tons of different things, I am exceptional with tremendous experience in the following fields:
        <br /><br />
        --Pet Sitting - all pets love me.
        <br />
        --Dance Instruction - all dancers love me.
        <br />
        --Home Security - all crooks hate me.
        <br />
        --Stunt Double - I can do stuff and things.
